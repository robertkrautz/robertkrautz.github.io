The Tissue Gene Regulation lab adheres to the <a href="https://mentorfirst.org">#MentorFirst</a> principle that emphasizes the value of the researcher behind the work. Productive, successful research is an emergent property of motivated, well mentored lab members that feel freedom in and ownership of their projects.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Build environment</b><br>
To allow all lab members to succeed in their respective research endeavors, we create an environment in which career stage or titles do not discourage free scientific expression and thinking and in which proper representation from Bachelor to PI level is given. As research is a team effort, we not only need to respect each other, but also assume responsibility for one another. For instance, while allowing flexibility in working hours allows everyone to work when they are most productive, we need to balance this to permit overlap with the other lab members, to create the chance to learn from each other and to enable an ongoing scientific dialogue.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Create dialogue</b><br>
It requires ambition, independence and resilience from the person spearheading a project to see this project through from start to finish. However, conversations and interactions with others can not only provide insights and understanding, but also inspiration, motivation and acknowledgement. We are all responsible of contributing to this with attention during presentations and in meetings as well as incorporating all lab members in conversations and finding solutions, giving each other room to be different as a human being and as a researcher.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Foster creativity</b><br>
The competitive nature of research risks a plethora of reactions, most prominently pushing the limits of how hard one can work to achieve set goals. However, we firmly believe that creativity is born from associations with subjects, patterns, concepts and narratives from all walks of life. For this, a decent work-life balance is central. We will hence encourage to take time off  including holidays, but also suggest to slot in regular recess for reading related scientific literature or project planning.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Take responsibility</b><br>
Despite the absolute need for an inner drive to boldly go where no one else has gone before, my responsibility as a supervisor is to assist, guide and support by providing time for each lab member and to motivate both personnel and the projects. Such motivation is inextricably linked to finding and conveying the meaning of the work we do and reminding ourselves throughout the daily grind of that bigger picture and the impact our work should have.
</p>
<p align="justify">
My responsibility in this is also to provide thought-through, structured and realistic, research projects, back-up plans or “low risk-lesser impact” side projects to ensure success even in the unlikely case of a failed main project. In parallel, I will also encourage to take courses, participate in conferences and contribute to writing and mentoring. My goal is for the lab members to become independent in managing their projects, collaborations and experiments and to seek new challenges and learning opportunities. The hope is that empowered and successful lab members will continue contributing to academia and society with sound scientific work after their stint in the lab.
