The Tissue Gene Regulation lab bridges the gap between gene regulatory mechanisms, transcriptional activation of enhancers and promoters in single cells on the one hand and the development of tissues and its dysregulation during disease on the other. For this, we devise new genomics methods and single cell techniques - both experimentally and computationally - to profile enhancers and promoters, model their activities and decode their interactions. In this way, we can pinpoint the time point and cell type where genetic variants begin to disrupt normal development – crucial information to develop new diagnostic approaches and identify therapeutic targets.

We are part of the [Section for Computational and RNA Biology](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/scarb/) at the [Department of Biology](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/) of the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en). As such we are incredibly grateful for an amazing infrastructure at the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=da&geocode=&q=Ole+Maal%C3%B8es+Vej+5+2200+K%C3%B8benhavn+N&sll=55.701833,12.560464&sspn=0.010882,0.026951&ie=UTF8&ll=55.698667,12.557888&spn=0.010883,0.026951&z=16&iwloc=cent&om=1">Biocenter</a> located at the outskirts of Copenhagen's inner city in close proximity to the [Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC)](https://www.bric.ku.dk) as well as the [Faculty of Health and Medical Science](https://sund.ku.dk).
